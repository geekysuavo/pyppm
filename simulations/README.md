# pyppm/simulations

All circuit simulations are placed in subdirectories here. You will need
[ngspice and ngnutmeg] (http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/) to run the
simulations.

In any of the design subdirectories, you can run `./build` to create the
output files and `./clean` to remove the built output files.
