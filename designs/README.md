# pyppm/designs

All hardware designs are placed in subdirectories here. You will need
[gEDA gschem] (http://www.geda-project.org/) and [gEDA PCB] (
http://pcb.geda-project.org/) to view the raw design sources.

In any of the design subdirectories, you can run `./edit` to open the schematic
editor. To open the printed circuit board editor, run `./edit pcb` instead.
